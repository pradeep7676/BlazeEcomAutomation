1. HomePage Object Errors
Issue: HomePage object has no attribute errors.

Description: Test cases are failing because the HomePage object lacks expected attributes or methods such as select_product, go_to_cart, and possibly others.
Resolution: Ensure that the HomePage class is correctly defined with all necessary methods and attributes.
2. JavaScript Execution Errors
Issue: JavascriptException when attempting to scroll.

Description: Tests are failing due to errors when executing JavaScript to scroll elements into view.
Resolution: Verify that the elements exist and are interactable before attempting to scroll. Ensure proper handling of JavaScript execution in your test scripts.
3. Type Errors
Issue: TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable.

Description: Test failures caused by attempting to call a tuple as if it were a function.
Resolution: Correctly use the elements returned by locators and ensure proper function calls in the test scripts.
4. Timeout Exceptions
Issue: TimeoutException while waiting for elements or alerts.

Description: Tests are failing because the expected elements or alerts are not appearing within the specified timeout period.
Resolution: Increase the timeout period if necessary, verify that the elements or alerts are indeed expected at that point in the workflow, and ensure the application is in the correct state before the wait.
5. Assertion Errors
Issue: Failed assertions due to incorrect or unexpected values.

Description: Assertions fail when the actual values do not match the expected values (e.g., product not added to cart, success messages not displayed).
Resolution: Ensure that the application logic correctly updates the state and UI elements as expected. Double-check the test assertions for accuracy.
6. Login Page Errors
Issue: LoginPage object has no attribute is_login_page.

Description: Tests for logout are failing because the LoginPage class lacks the is_login_page method.
Resolution: Implement the is_login_page method in the LoginPage class to verify the user is on the login page after logging out.
7. Incorrect Method Usage
Issue: Method naming and usage issues.

Description: Functions like click_on_cart are used incorrectly in the test scripts.
Resolution: Correctly implement and use methods as per the class definitions. Ensure method names match their intended functionality.
8. Checkout Process Failures
Issue: Errors during the checkout process.

Description: The checkout process tests are failing due to missing methods, failed assertions, or timeout issues.
Resolution: Verify the entire checkout process workflow and ensure that all necessary steps are correctly implemented in the test scripts.
